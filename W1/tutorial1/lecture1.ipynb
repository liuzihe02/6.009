    "# Administrivia\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to 6.009!  Today we're using the section slots for a few copies of a shorter-than-usual lecture, and here are the notes and code to go along with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to know is that [our web site](https://mit.edu/6.009) has all the info on 6.009!  We'll repeat some highlights here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is the Class About?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice in the fundamentals of programming!**  Just like you can't learn a sport by reading a textbook and answering multiple-choice questions, you can't learn programming without doing lots of it.  We will structure the lectures and assignments around big-picture topics like recursion, data structures, and object-oriented design.  However, in parallel to that \"programming literacy\" element, you'll keep building your programming skills, on programs significantly more complex than in our prerequisite subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do stick to Python as the 6.009 implementation language, though most of what you learn should generalize to other popular programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We're pretty strict about enforcing our prerequisite of 6.00, 6.0001, 6.0002, or 6.145.  We know which students have completed those classes (by advanced-standing exam or the old-fashioned way), and our web site won't let others submit the assignments or quizzes (so they're free to stay enrolled in the class, but they won't like their grades!).\n",
    "\n",
    "We really do build on the prerequisite material to start with more advanced material.  This is *not* a first programming class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Staff\n",
    "\n",
    "We have 100-some staff members this semester!  There are two instructors, one of whom this week is delivering the lecture you're attending based on these notes.  Generally the instructors will split the lectures.  We also have 18 teaching assistants (TAs), plus over 100 laboratory assistants (LAs), who you will get to know in sections and office hours, as all-purpose assistants in getting your Python code right.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Happens in a Typical Week?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monday: Lecture.**  Like this one, all of our lectures will involve a mix of illustrating big-picture concepts on screen and/or board, demonstrating interesting Python programs, and writing some Python code together.  Each lecture focuses on a particular topic, which generally then becomes the subject of the next laboratory assignment to be released.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Laboratory Assignments: released on and due on Fridays.**  These are the heart of the 6.009 experience!  We provide you with starter code to show a cool user interface on top of Python code that you will write from scratch.  Grading is based almost entirely on test cases that we provide to you in advance; pass all of them and you are lined up for full credit on the programming part.  There are also some concept questions you must answer to earn some of the remaining credit.  Furthermore, credit for passing test cases is only confirmed once you pass a *checkoff* conversation with a member of our staff in office hours, where you must demonstrate understanding of your code.  We also like to give students tips during these conversations on how to improve their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quizzes: about one per month, Wednesday evenings.**  Three weeks of the semester have quizzes instead of labs coming due.  Our quizzes look just like mini versions of our labs: download starter code that explains several programming puzzles you are to solve (based cumulatively on material covered in labs to that point), to be graded in terms of test cases passed.  You must write the code on your laptop in class.  A twist is that we let you earn back some partial credit, if you don't get all the tests passing during the quiz.  We give you a few days to fix your code and submit it for a *regrade*, where we inspect the \"before\" and \"after\" versions to give back credit in proportion to how close to finished the \"before\" version was.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tutorials** happen during our scheduled Wednesday sections.  Staff members go through additional examples to prepare you for the labs about to be released.  After the tutorial presentation is over, these sessions turn into open office hours, where you can put yourself in the queue to be helped by instructors, TAs, or LAs.  We also give checkoffs in these sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Friday sections** are pure office hours, like Wednesdays but without tutorials first.  Our **additional evening office hours** work the same.  (Stay tuned for times and places of evening office hours to be confirmed!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How are Final Grades Assigned?\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs add up to 40% of the final grade, with each lab weighed equally.  Then the three quizzes count respectively 15%, 20%, and 25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a gradual lateness-penalty policy for labs, explained with a Python program on our web site.  Each student also has **three automatic four-day extensions** on labs, which our grade calculator automatically activates in whichever way optimizes your final grade.  S^3 notes of support are needed for any further extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collaboration Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is very important that every student read and understand [our collaboration policy](https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/information#catsoop_section_6)!**  As a newcomer to programming, it's hard to know which parts of the experience are essential to go through firsthand.  Our policy is designed to help you have those experiences, and for fairness to all students we enforce the policy strictly.  Sadly enough, we typically catch dozens of students a semester copying from each other, etc.  We report serious cases to the MIT Office of Student Citizenship, and building up a record there can lead to some pretty unpleasant penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to emphasize that for most of you *it is not going to be obvious now what counts as copying*, so please read our policy thoroughly!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to Install on your Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Please install **Python version 3.6 or higher**.  You may also want to install the cute Jupyter Notebook tool being used to display these lecture notes with runnable code.  Our web site's front page begins with a link to installation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're happy with students using a variety of editors to write their Python code.  No particular editor is required or blessed by the staff.  We will do our best to help with whatever editor you choose.  For instance, if you like the editor endorsed by the prerequisite subject you took, feel free to stick with it."

    "# The N-Queens Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The 8-Queens problem on a chessboard corresponds to finding a placement of 8 queens such that no queen attacks any other queen.  This means that\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. No two queens can be on the same column.\n",
    " 2. No two queens can be on the same row.\n",
    " 3. No two queens can be on the same diagonal.\n",

    "\n",
    "And here’s a solution to the 5-queens problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "![5X5 solution](board4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But how can we find the above solutions or different ones? Let’s simplify the problem first.  Suppose we look at a smaller 2 × 2 board. Can we place two queens so they don’t attack each other?  The answer is no since a queen on any square of a 2 × 2 board can attack every other square.\n",
    "\n",
    "![2X2 empty board](board5.png)\n",

    "What about a 3 × 3 board? Here is an attempt:\n",
    "\n",
    "![3X3 attempt](board6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first placement (above left), we can see that the queen attacks six other squares and occupies one.  So there are 7 squares that are disallowed by the very first queen placement, leaving 2 squares available. When we put the second queen on one of those squares, there are no squares available. Of course, we could have tried putting the first queen in a different spot, but that won’t help.  The first queen regardless of where it is placed will occupy and attack at least 7 squares, leaving two. There is no solution for a 3 × 3 board.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systematic Search\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a 4 × 4 board? Let’s be systematic about searching for a solution. We will try to place queens column by column and change placements if we fail. We start by placing a queen in the top left corner in the first column as shown below (first picture). There are two choices in placing a queen on the second column and we choose one as shown in the second picture below.  Now we are stuck! We can’t place a queen in the third column. :(\n",
    " \n",
    "![4X4 attempt](board7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when we tried to place the third queen in the third column above we simply checked that the third queen didn’t conflict with the first and the second.  We do not need to check that the first two queens do not conflict with each other.  This is because we did that check when we placed the second queen.  This will be important to remember when we look at the code to check for conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we failed at finding a solution, should we give up? No, because we could try a different positioning for the second queen. Here we go:\n",
    "\n",
    "![4X4 attempt](board8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We went further, but are stuck again, this time on the fourth and last column. :(\n",
    "But we are not out of options.  We arbitrarily chose the top corner for the first queen and we could try a different position. (There are four options for the first queen.)  Here we go:\n",
    "\n",
    "![4X4 attempt](board9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Success: the 4-queens problem has a solution. :) It actually has two; try to find a different one.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will take a normal person quite a long time to use this strategy to find a solution to the 8-queens problem.  But such an exhaustive brute-force strategy should work.  And if we can code up the solution, since computers can do calculations billions of times faster than humans, we will able to run the program and find a solution in a matter of seconds!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in writing code for 8-queens is to decide on a data structure for the problem: How are we going to represent the board and the positions of the queens?"

It turns out because we are only looking for solutions where there is a single queen on each row (or for that matter column), we can get away with using a one-dimensional array where each index represents each row of the board and the entry represents the column on which the queen resides.\n",

This is important because we will want to build up a solution from an empty board as in our first algorithm.  Of course, in our algorithm we placed queens in rows beginning from left to right, but that was an arbitrary choice.\n",

Not only is the 1-D representation more compact, it also saves us from checking one of the rules.  For the second rule that checks that no column contains two or more queens, we just need to make sure that no number appears more than once in the array. The third rule involves slightly more computation.\n",
