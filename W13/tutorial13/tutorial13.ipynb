    "Communication on the web can take many forms. Basically the client making a request and the server responding need to agree on a standard language for communication. This language will dictate what requests and responses look like. They are called protocols. There are different protocols used for getting webpages, for streaming video, and for sending email.\n",

One of those things, that you'll hear referenced a lot in computer science, is caching. Caching, in its simplest terms, is basically saving things so that if you need to use them again, they'll be available. Our browsers do a lot of caching to make them more performant. For example, if you visit Facebook.com a lot, your browser might have logos, images, and other resources from Facebook servers saved / cached so that the next time you go back to Facebook, you don't have to request them again. \n",
