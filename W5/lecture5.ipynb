    "In this lecture, we learn about linked structures, a family of data structures that can be visualized with diagrams of boxes with arrows between them.  That style is a natural match with recursion, which we have been studying so far mostly in the context of search problems.  Linked structures are related to the concept of pointers in some non-Python languages, and recursion and pointers together have been [described](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/) as the defining difficult concepts of programming or computer science.  If nothing else, practicing these concepts will prepare you for the interview questions that the big-name software companies like to use!  It doesn't hurt that these ideas also form the bedrock for most kinds of algorithmically challenging coding."

It turns out that aliasing can enable some satisfyingly elegant programming styles, including one that we focus on in the rest of the lecture, which allows us to maintain *several closely related copies of a data structure, reusing space across them*.

Before we get there, we need to have a clear model of how data structures are laid out in memory.  The \"boxes and arrows\" diagrams we just used turn out to be pretty accurate.  We can think of a Python list (array) as a sequence of cells sitting next to each other.  Think of it as the first cell of a list having address `N` in memory, such that it is easy to look up the `i`th cell, because we compute its address as `N+i`.  The underlying computer provides fast implementations for both addition and looking up a cell by address.\n",

With arrays (Python lists), we can look up the 1000th element of `myList` like `myList[999]`.  With linked lists, we need to follow every arrow from the beginning node (called the root) onward, until hitting element `1000`!\n",

We illustrate this rule in tagging nodes with their intervals.  ‚ÄúZigging left‚Äù pulls down the high end of the interval to equal the value we've skipped, and ‚Äúzagging right‚Äù pushes up the low end of the interval to equal the value we've skipped.\n",
