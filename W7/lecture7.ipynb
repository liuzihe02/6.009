    "Programming is hard.  The key to taming its challenges is to divide a complex program into smaller pieces, where each piece is easier to understand.  Different pieces might be divvied up among the different coders on a team, but careful division of a large code base even makes sense for a lone programmer.  If you don't believe us, try looking back at your code from one of the early labs and see how well you remember it!  Careful program design makes it easy for an informed coder to understand and modify a program.  When the program has well-defined top-level structure, often we can tell that we only need to make changes in one piece.  Then we only need to understand that piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen decomposing a program into functions.  Another essential tool of decomposition is *encapsulation*, associated with the idea of *abstract data types (ADTs)*.  An ADT implementation connects a data structure with a set of useful operations on that structure.  The idea is that the details of the data structure are *hidden* from code using the ADT.  That way, the ADT implementation can be modified *independently* from all the other bits of code that depend on it.  You can imagine that one programmer is responsible for the ADT, and another programmer is responsible for coding some algorithm that uses the ADT.  These two programmers can now go about their business simultaneously, potentially finishing the project twice as fast as if they hadn't chosen this decomposition!  The story is even better when the ADT implementation and algorithm are both evolving over time, and each can be improved without affecting the other.  Again, this advantage is significant even with a lone programmer.\n",

    "\n",
    "What does it mean to be indistinguishable?  Roughly, it means that no sequence of method calls can tell the difference.  All corresponding method calls return the same values with both implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One small catch is that method calls returning instances of the two classes we are comparing probably *won't* return equal values.  We *want* them to be different, because we bothered to write two different classes!  As long as some methods return values in base types like integer or Booleans, we can still test result equality on those methods, which is enough to give a useful notion of indistinguishability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a fully formal definition of ADT correctness, we'll defer to 6.031 and other follow-on classes.  Here, though, let's use an approximation: for all possible method call sequences within some size bounds, the two classes should return the same answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, we'll define a set of classes that stand for path methods.  An object of one of these classes can be asked to call that method on a path object, and we can also ask if this method generates a new object of the same class (\"mutates\")."

    "*Encapsulation*, or information hiding, is one of the big ideas in effective program design.  One common embodiment of the idea is *abstract data types*, which package together operations on some hidden representation type.  We've highlighted a few key points about the versatility of abstract data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code can be written generically in some ADT, so that the code works when any implementation of the ADT is plugged in.**  This way, ADT implementations and their client programs can be coded, understood, and maintained separately.\n",
    "- **A correct implementation of an ADT appears to behave identically to the simple reference implementation on any sequence of method calls.**  That way, the former really is a drop-in replacement for the latter, and programmers may pretend that they are using the simpler reference implementation when they are actually using a more clever implementation.\n",
    "- There is not just one “best” implementation of any ADT: **we often want to implement one ADT differently for different problem contexts, appealing to the same generic algorithms that work “for free” given any implementation of the ADT.**  These custom implementations often improve performance by taking advantage of restrictions on the data that appear in the problem at hand.\n",
    "- **The same principles apply in roughly the same way to ADTs that are mutable (operations modify the data structure) or immutable (operations return new versions of the data structure).**\n",
    "- **It is possible and useful to parameterize one ADT implementation over another.**  This design technique supports *hierarchical* program decomposition, where a complex design is broken into a tree of pieces that are successively combined into more complex pieces.  Different members of a coding team can take responsibility for different pieces and work independently of improvements to the others, and even lone programmers can benefit from the chance to focus in on one part of a program, knowing that details of other parts don't directly influence its workings."
